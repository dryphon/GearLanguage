# GearLanguage
A programming language interpreter written in Free Pascal
See the PDF included for more information about the Gear language. It also includes 16 chapters that explain exactly (including code) how the language evolved. In the appendix a description of the language is available.
Gear is a multi-paradigm language: procedural, functional and object-oriented.
Currently, it is only an interpreter, but there are plans to create a compiler as well.
